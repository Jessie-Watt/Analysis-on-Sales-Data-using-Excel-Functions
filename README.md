# Task-3

# **Introduction**

This task was resolved using the previous sales data used in task 2, but with advanced excel functions and formulas. The advance functions were used to determine the total revenue and average revenue of a particular product in a particular country, and their numbers of sales in specific segments.

# **Activity**
To Calculate:
The average revenue generated from each sale of Paseo
The number of sales made in the goverment and Midmarket segment
The total revenue generated from the sales of 'Montana' in Canada
The highest unit of goods sold in Country, Segment and Month
What is the total profit made in December
 

# **Skills Demonstrated**
1. Data Manipulation
2. The use of 'AverageIF' function
3. The use of 'CountIF' function
4. The Use of 'SumIF' and 'SumIFS' functions
5. The use of 'Xlookup' and 'Vlookup' function

# **Data Manipulation**
Paseo average sales were generated using 'AverageIF' function. The averageif function was applied to the entire 'sales' column inputting the product range first, followed by the criteria, before the average_range was specified, this automatically generated the answer to the average revenue obtained for the Paseo products sold. The Total number of Sales made in Government and Midmarket was calculated applying the 'countif' function to the 'sales' column, the segment range will be considered first before the criteria "Government"  this automatically calculate the number of sales for government and midmarket. The summation of the number of sales for government and midmarket will gave the total number sales for gov. and midmarket.


To determine the total revenue of Montana in Canada the 'sumifs' function was applied to the sale column stating the sum range first, then the criteria range followed by the criteria. Sumifs function gives more option to multiple criteria range and criteria, to be applied. The total profit made in December was calculated using 'sumif' function. While the highest units sold was calculated using the 'max' fuctione applied to the unit sold column. The results to the task and the function formula used can be seen in the screenshot below.

The highest units sold in the segment, Country and month section was determined using the Xlookup and Vlookup function and whose answers can be seen in the screenshot above.

# **Conclusion**
This task broadened my use of advanced excel formulas, I look forward to using these functions in my personal practice.
